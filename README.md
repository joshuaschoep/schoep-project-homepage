# schoep-project-homepage
This is a start page to access a much larger database of projects that I am building. It holds the homepage with navigation links to get further into the site.

## Javascript
The main point of me doing all this was to be both a full-stack developer on a project (start to finish) and to be a system administrator, with all the annoyances of that. This part of the project is the most simple and is, therefore, the first one complete. It is a NodeJS server hosting a few static pages with information to get elsewhere. The only complexity in the javascript is that it routes an HTTP server to link to HTTPS, and gives out certificates from Let's Encrypt on that channel.

## HTML
Since the pages are static, all of the DOM is built with HTML. This builds the actual meat of the website, and allows navigation throughout pages.

## CSS
This is where I had fun, because I like CSS. All the CSS is custom made by an ameteur, so expect it to be somewhat mediocre. It is, however, responsive, and gets the job done in terms of displaying a decent looking site.
