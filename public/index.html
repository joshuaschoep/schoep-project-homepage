        This is a side-project to present myself<br>
        It is both a presentation website for my coding,
        and a database for my current academic projects.

                    <p>
                    I often find that I want a way to present my side projects without
		    needing to create repositories on other computers, so there's no
		    better way than to combine them all in a series of webapps.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    As well as this, I wish to present information about myself and my
		    abilities in computer science and software engineering in a concise way.
